# QuadwaveÂ MIDIÂ Bridge

Turn the **Misaâ€¯Quadwave's** custom SysEx snapshots into humanâ€‘readable
console output or any controlâ€‘logic you want. The script *doesn't generate
MIDI itself* (passâ€‘through only) â€“ it's a hackâ€‘ready scaffold for you to
generate any MIDI you like.

## What It Prints

| Input                        | Console output                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Neck packet                  | `StringÂ NÂ fretÂ FÂ ON` **or** `OFF` for every state change                |
| Touch panel                  | `pressed` / `released` and `dragged` (when X/Y moves while pressed) |
| Config change (5â€‘finger tap) | Config set to <color> + Firmware version:Â Major.Minor.Patch                         |
| Anything else                | Sent straight through to the chosen MIDI OUT                            |

Example stream:

```
String 1 fret 1 ON
Touch 0 pressed  at x=4560 y=2120
Touch 0 dragged  to x=4900 y=2440
String 1 fret 1 OFF
Touch 0 released at x=4900 y=2440
```

## QuickÂ Start

```bash
pip install mido python-rtmidi   # deps

# macOS / Linux â€“ creates a virtual port "QuadwaveÂ Bridge"
python quadwave_midi_bridge.py

# Windows â€“ point it at a loopMIDI cable you created
Install loopMIDI (free) and create a loopback port called "misa-loopback".
python quadwave_midi_bridge.py --out-port "misa-loopback"
```

Make sure the Misa Quadwave is in 'Raw Mode' (press and hold the highest fret on 
each string for 3 seconds). This mode will send the Sysex messages expected by the
Quadwave Bridge.

In Ableton or any DAW's settings, select the new MIDI output.

## Packet Format (firmwareÂ â‰¥Â v2.4.0)

### Neck (12 byte payload)

* **3Â bytes per string** â†’ 12â€‘byte payload.
* After deâ€‘7â€‘bitâ€‘ifying you get a **16â€‘bit mask** â€“ **bitâ€‘0Â =Â fretâ€‘1 â€¦ bitâ€‘15Â =
  fretâ€‘16**.  No gaps, no padding.

### Touch panel (31 byte payload)

* Always `1Â +Â 5Ã—MAX_TOUCHESÂ =Â 31` data bytes.
* ByteÂ 0Â = number of active touches.  Each touch =
  `x_lo, x_hi, y_lo, y_hi, z (pressure), pressed_bool` 
* X and Y coords are 14â€‘bit.

### Config change (75 byte payload)

* Sent when allÂ 5 touch IDs are pressed at once: `config_id  fw_major  fw_minor  fw_patch`.
* config_id â†’ 0Â =Â blue,Â 1Â =Â green,Â 2Â =Â purple
* As well as the 4 bytes above, it includes the full stored eeprom configuration on the Quadwave.
  This structure is currently not documented here.
* The bridge simply prints the decoded colour and firmware version.

## Hacking

Start at the QuadwaveBridge's _handle method. It's fairly self-explanatory.

---

## Dev &Â Tests

```bash
# run unit tests (hardwareâ€‘free)
python -m unittest -v test_quadwave_bridge.py
```

The tests mock all MIDI I/O.
